I'm taking a collaborative training with smart methods company and they asked meto do some tasks I made this project
in 1.8.2021 by Tinkercard the Components that I used are Arduino Uno R3, Breadboard small 1micro servo and potentiometer 250 
and sources for this code were taken from this link, https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lD4jAmYkW8K-exercise-1-potentiometer-control-of-multiple-servo-motors
but I followed this steps of this channel in youtube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjFsRCiA92k&list=LL&index=1&t=346s
